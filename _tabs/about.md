## ... Me

I'm a Microsoft 365 Administrator with a focus on IAM and automation using PowerShell and the MS Graph. I focus on force multiplier solutions to make it possible for small teams to manage big crows.

## ... This Site

This site is meant part as an outlet for me to rant about PowerShell automation, Microsoft solutions, and everything in between. The other part is hopefully helpful tips, tricks, and snippits of code from the trail and errors thats is the web of options that PowerShell, Azure, and Microsoft 365 offers.
